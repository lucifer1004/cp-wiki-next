# Google Kick Start

Kick Start is a starter's level CP contest held by Google. There are 8 rounds every year, between March and November.

Each contest lasts 3 hours. Starting from 2020, there are 4 problems in every contest, and there are no more hidden verdicts, meaning that all results can be seen instantaneously.
